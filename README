= OpenRubyRMBot

The bot that hangs around in #OpenRubyRMK on freenode.net (or
everywhere you configure him to hang around). It’s default
configuration is a bit OpenRubyRMK-specific (as that is the primary
purpose he has been developed for), but with a little bit of work he
can be made to cooperate just fine with developer teams from other
projects. It is inteded to only run on *nixish systems, but if you
want to put some effort into the code, you’ll probably be able to run
it on other platforms.

OpenRubyRMBot features both a readable and well-documented
configuration file and a plugin system allowing you to add/remove
functionality you (don’t) desire. Under the hood it uses the
{em-irc lirbrary}[https://github.com/jch/em-irc], which is based on
EventMachine[http://rubyeventmachine.com] and therefore should scale
well.

It is able to both parse all public messages posted into a channel and
to process private messages directly targetted at the bot. The former
can cause a so-called "trigger" to be activated, making the bot taking
action and posting something (or doing something else you define), the
latter are understand as "commands" that are intended to make the bot
acting in some way.

== Usage

To start the bot:

  $ bin/open_ruby_rmbot

To log to standard output (debugging mode automatically activated):

  $ bin/open_ruby_rmbot -d

To configure:

  $ $EDITOR config/open_ruby_rmbot.conf

== Plugins

Plugins usually come as a single Ruby file you have to place inside
the plugins/ directory of your OpenRubyRMBot installation. In order to
enable the plugin after installation, open up config/plugins.conf and
add the plugin’s name (should be mentioned in the plugin’s
documentation) to the bottom of that file on its own line.

If you want to actually write a plugin yourself, have a look at the
OpenRubyRMBot::IRCBot class which contains a short tutorial on how to
write a plugin adding a simple echo functionality to OpenRubyRMBot.
