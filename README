= OpenRubyRMBot

The bot that hangs around in #OpenRubyRMK on freenode.net (or
everywhere you configure him to hang around). It’s default
configuration is a bit OpenRubyRMK-specific (as that is the primary
purpose he has been developed for), but with a little bit of work he
can be made to cooperate just fine with developer teams from other
projects. It is inteded to only run on *nixish systems, but if you
want to put some effort into the code, you’ll probably be able to run
it on other platforms.

OpenRubyRMBot features both a readable and well-documented
configuration file and a plugin system allowing you to add/remove
functionality you (don’t) desire. Under the hood it uses the
{Cinch lirbrary}[https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch].
